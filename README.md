# Exoplanet Explorer üåå

Exoplanet Explorer is a fun, educational mobile application that combines learning about space with interactive games. Users can explore content from NASA, participate in quizzes, match planets, and keep track of their progress on a leaderboard. The app is built using **Flutter** and integrates with **Firebase** for real-time data and user authentication.

## Features üöÄ

- **Exoplanet Learning Module**: Structured content on exoplanets, including articles, videos, and games.
- **NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)**: View NASA's APOD images and explanations.
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Answer topic-based questions to test your knowledge.
- **Matching Games**: Match planets with their names in an engaging drag-and-drop interface.
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with others and track your progress on daily, weekly, and all-time leaderboards.
- **Profile Management**: Track user achievements, rankings, and upload profile pictures.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Data is synced in real-time using Firebase.

## Future Plans

We're excited to share our vision for future enhancements in **Exoplanet Explorer**:

- **AI-Generated Quizzes**:
   - **Dynamic Quiz Generation**: The application will use AI algorithms to create personalized quizzes based on user preferences, learning history, and performance metrics.
   - **User Database**: Each quiz attempt will be saved in the user database, allowing us to track individual progress and performance over time.
   - **Correct Answers Tracking**: The application will store the correct answers alongside the user responses.
   - **Feedback Mechanism**: After each quiz, users will receive feedback highlighting their correct answers and areas for improvement.

## In Development

We're actively working on bringing the following exciting games to **Exoplanet Explorer**:

- **Puzzle Challenge**:
   - **Interactive Jigsaw**: Users piece together a jigsaw puzzle that forms an image related to exoplanets (e.g., an exoplanet, telescope, or detection method).
   - **Educational Content**: When a piece is placed correctly, a fact or question appears related to that part of the image.
   - **Time-Based Levels**: Introduce a time limit for added challenge.

- **Space Adventure Game**:
   - **Concept**: Users navigate a spaceship through space, collecting stars by answering questions correctly.
   - **Gameplay**: Each correct answer moves the spaceship forward. Wrong answers cause obstacles, slowing progress.
   - **Progression**: Different levels represent different missions or planets to explore.

- **Exoplanet Builder**:
   - **Concept**: Users build their own exoplanet by answering questions correctly.
   - **Game Mechanics**: For each correct answer, users earn resources to add features to their planet (e.g., atmosphere, oceans, moons).
   - **End Goal**: Create a habitable exoplanet by the end of the quiz.

- **Memory Game**:
   - **Flashcards Memory Game**: Users must remember and match pairs of cards showing related concepts (e.g., exoplanet names and their characteristics).
   - **Learning Integration**: Provide interesting facts or questions when pairs are matched correctly.

Stay tuned for these upcoming features and prepare for a space-filled adventure of learning and fun! These features are coming soon, and we can't wait to share them with you! Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance the learning and gaming experience.
